The Public Service Launchpad is for people on a mission. It is powered by Hub Launchpad and FutureGov. 

Whether it is changing part of the care system, supporting families towards economic security or enabling public service professionals to use data more effectively, we can help you turn questions that matter into great collaborations, projects or companies. 

We offer intensive startup support and seed investment for 16 teams on our Public Service Launchpad Accelerator. We have also built a community of over 100 Public Service Launchpad Scholars who are supporting each other to make innovative ideas happen within their organisations or outside of them.
